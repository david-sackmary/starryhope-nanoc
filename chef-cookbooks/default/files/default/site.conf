  # No default expire rule. This config mirrors that of apache as outlined in the
  # html5-boilerplate .htaccess file. However, nginx applies rules by location, the apache rules
  # are defined by type. A concequence of this difference is that if you use no file extension in
  # the url and serve html, with apache you get an expire time of 0s, with nginx you'd get an
  # expire header of one month in the future (if the default expire rule is 1 month).
  # Therefore, do not use a default expire rule with nginx unless your site is completely static
